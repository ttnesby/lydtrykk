# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A static, backend-free web app: a Haskell domain-logic library compiled to
WebAssembly (via Miso + GHC's wasm32-wasi backend) that answers "how far /
how loud" questions for a heat-pump outdoor unit against NS 8175 noise
limits. Two UIs share one WASM binary and one domain module:

- `frontend/static/index.html` — the Miso calculator app.
- `frontend/static/lydnivakart.html` — a Leaflet map simulator that places
  multiple units and computes cumulative/spatial noise, calling into the
  *same* `app.wasm` in "reactor mode" (no `hs_start`, so Miso never mounts).

All UI text, comments, and commit messages are in Norwegian (bokmål).

## Commands

### Native tests (fast path — no wasm toolchain needed)

```sh
cabal test all
```

Run a single test group/case by name (tasty pattern match on the test tree
path, e.g. group "gylne verdier..." > case "..."):

```sh
cabal test lyd-core-test --test-options="--pattern <substring>"
```

### JS tests (node, no dependencies)

The pure JS modules (`frontend/static/gridGeo.js` — projection/marching
squares, `frontend/static/migrering.js` — save-format migration,
`frontend/static/husrekker.js` — UTM33→WGS84 + husrekke-json normalisation)
are tested with node's built-in runner:

```sh
node --test frontend/test/*.test.mjs
```

### WASM build (full app, needed to exercise either HTML page for real)

Requires [ghc-wasm-meta](https://gitlab.haskell.org/haskell-wasm/ghc-wasm-meta)
(GHC 9.12 flavour):

```sh
curl -f -L --retry 5 https://gitlab.haskell.org/haskell-wasm/ghc-wasm-meta/-/raw/master/bootstrap.sh -o bootstrap.sh
FLAVOUR=9.12 sh bootstrap.sh
source ~/.ghc-wasm/env

./build.sh                       # -> dist/ (app.wasm + static files)
python3 -m http.server -d dist   # open http://localhost:8000
```

Without a wasm build, both HTML pages still run: `wasmInit.js` tries the local
`app.wasm` first, and when that fails it loads the deployed binary (plus its
paired `ghc_wasm_jsffi.js`) from `https://ttnesby.github.io/lydtrykk/` —
GitHub Pages serves both with CORS `*` and correct MIME types. This is enough
to iterate on UI/map logic without the wasm toolchain installed, but it needs
network access, and a *new* JSFFI export that only exists on your branch is
absent from the deployed binary — exercising it requires a local build (or
the PR preview) until it reaches `main`.

There is no separate lint/format command wired up; Haskell is formatted with
ormolu via HLS (2-space indent, see `.zed/settings.json`), not enforced by CI.

## Architecture

### Two cabal projects, one reason

- `cabal.project` — native, `lyd-core` only. What `cabal test all` and CI's
  test job use. wasm32-wasi-ghc cannot easily run a test-suite binary, so all
  tests run natively against pure Haskell.
- `cabal.project.wasm` — `lyd-core` + `frontend`, built only with
  `wasm32-wasi-cabal` (via `build.sh`). This is what produces `app.wasm`.

### `lyd-core` is the single source of truth

`lyd-core/src/Lyd/Beregning.hs` is a pure, Miso-free library: the NS 8175
limit table (4 classes A/B+/B/C × 3 tidsrom, offsets 10/7/5/0 dBA from the
class-C minimum), the free-field point-source model (inverse-square + cosine
directional correction), its inverse (level → distance), cumulative
logarithmic summation for multiple sources, and required-cabinet-attenuation.
`lyd-core/src/Lyd/Felt.hs` builds on it with the map simulator's grid field:
placed sources in a local plane (bearing 0° = north, clockwise), per-point
cumulative level with the 1 m distance clamp, the row-stripe loop
(`rutenettStripe`) that `acoustics_gridStripe` exposes, and the husrekke
shielding model (`rutenettStripeSkjermet`/`nivaaIPunktSkjermet`, exposed as
`acoustics_gridStripeSkjermet`): cells inside a building polygon become NaN
(masked — outdoor limits apply outside facades), and a source contribution
whose sight line properly crosses a polygon gets a flat, deliberately
conservative `skjermingDb` = 10 dB deduction (real rows shield 15–25 dB; the
margin also covers unmodelled facade reflections). Grazing/touching sight
lines do NOT shield (conservative near row ends), and a source inside or
within 1 m of a polygon has that polygon exempted (`egetPolygon` — a pump
click can land numerically inside its own facade). Polygons are simplified
before masking/sight tests (`forenkletPolygon`, Douglas–Peucker at
`forenkleToleranseM` = 0.2 m — well inside the model noise of the flat 10 dB
deduction; real rows are digitized with 60–300 vertices): both the
spec path (`nivaaIPunktSkjermet`) and the hot path simplify identically, so
the cell-for-cell pinning tests stay exact. The hot path
(`nivaaMedHindre`, shared by the grid and the facade points) runs against
precomputed `Hinder` values — edges in flat unboxed vectors, bbox prefilter,
per-source `egetPolygon` exemption — and the stripe functions return a
Storable vector (contiguous pinned memory) so the wasm side can bulk-copy a
whole stripe out of linear memory in one FFI crossing. On top of the shielding
model sits `versteFasadepunkt` (exposed as `acoustics_fasadeVerst`): sample
points along a polygon's perimeter (`fasadepunkter`, 1 m outside the facade,
≤ 1 m apart) and pick the one with the highest cumulative level — the map's
«Verste punkt per rekke» markers. All simulator policy
deliberately kept out of `Beregning`. Everything else in the repo — the
calculator UI, the map simulator, and the grid workers — is a thin caller of
these modules. `lyd-core/test/Spec.hs` pins them down with golden values
(from a verified reference notebook), a round-trip QuickCheck property
(`lydnivaa (avstand lp) == lp`), and monotonicity properties. Change the
model here, and check tests — the JS side only *calls* the core (via WASM),
it never re-implements it.

### WASM export surface (`frontend/app/Main.hs`)

Under `#ifdef WASM` (set via `cpp-options: -DWASM` only when
`arch(wasm32)`, see `frontend/frontend.cabal`), `Main.hs` exports eight
*synchronous* JSFFI functions layered directly on `Lyd.Beregning`/`Lyd.Felt`:
`acoustics_dirGain`, `acoustics_reqDist`, `acoustics_levelAt`,
`acoustics_dbSum`, `acoustics_grense` (limit table by clamped
class/tidsrom enum indices — the map page builds its whole `GRENSE` matrix
from this at boot, so the NS 8175 numbers have no JS copy either; the
`KLASSER`/`TIDSROM` array order in `lydnivakart.html` must match the Haskell
enum order), `acoustics_gridStripe` (the batch grid call: pumps as a flat
stride-3 Float64Array, the whole result stripe copied into the JS-allocated
Float64Array in ONE `Float64Array(__exports.memory.buffer, ptr, n)` bulk copy
— input arrays are bulk-copied in the same way; per-element `$1[$2] = $3`
writes used to dominate the wasm runtime at hundreds of thousands of cells.
`__exports` is in scope in JSFFI import snippets via the closure
`post-link.mjs` generates, and the view must be rebuilt per call because
`memory.buffer` is replaced when the wasm memory grows),
`acoustics_gridStripeSkjermet` (same
plus husrekke polygons as a flat vertex array + per-polygon vertex counts;
see the shielding model under `lyd-core` above), and `acoustics_fasadeVerst`
(worst facade point per polygon, `[x, y, level]` stride-3 into a JS-allocated
array; called on the main thread from `oppdaterFasadeVerst`, skipped during
drag). The shielded variant is a
*new* export name rather than extra arguments on `acoustics_gridStripe`, on
purpose: `gridWorker.js` feature-detects it by name, and an older deployed
binary would otherwise silently ignore extra arguments and compute without
shielding; `acoustics_fasadeVerst` is feature-detected the same way (the
markers just stay off, with one console warning). Synchronous exports (the `" sync"` suffix
in the `foreign export javascript` declarations) are required because both
`lydnivakart.html` and `gridWorker.js` call them inside tight draw/compute
loops — an async/Promise-based export would be unworkable there. The linker
flags that actually expose these symbols from the wasm binary live in
`frontend.cabal`'s `--export=...` list, not in the Haskell source; adding a
new export needs both a `foreign export javascript` line *and* a matching
`--export` flag.

### Single implementation: all math lives in `Lyd.Beregning`

There are no JS copies of the acoustics formulas — nor of the limit table
(fetched via `acoustics_grense`, see above). Every call site (main thread in
`lydnivakart.html`, each `gridWorker.js` instance, and `index.js`) gets the
core through the shared two-stage boot in `wasmInit.js`: local `app.wasm`
first, then the deployed binary from GitHub Pages (see "Commands" above). If
neither loads — or the binary is too old to have `acoustics_grense` — the
pages show a visible error instead of silently computing wrong numbers: on
the map page, matrix/zones/grid render only after `bootAkustikk()` has
received the exports (guards in `drawPump`/`renderMatrise` cover map clicks
that arrive before then), and a worker without a core — or with a binary too
old to have `acoustics_gridStripe` — replies `{error: true}` so that grid
round is skipped.

### Runtime dependencies: vendored WASI shim, SRI-pinned Leaflet

The WASI shim (`@bjorn3/browser_wasi_shim@0.3.0` dist files) is vendored in
`frontend/static/vendor/wasi/` — wasm boot does not depend on jsdelivr being
up; upgrade by re-downloading the dist files. Leaflet still comes from cdnjs
but is pinned with SRI `integrity` hashes in `lydnivakart.html`; bumping the
Leaflet version requires recomputing those hashes
(`curl -s <url> | openssl dgst -sha384 -binary | openssl base64 -A`).

### Testable JS modules (`gridGeo.js`, `migrering.js`, `husrekker.js`)

The map page's main script is one ES module that imports the pure parts from
node-testable modules (`frontend/test/*.test.mjs`, run in CI before the
Haskell tests): `gridGeo.js` (local planar projection, `destPoint`/`bearing`,
marching squares — returns plain `{lat, lng}` objects, no Leaflet dependency),
`migrering.js` (`normaliserOppsett`, the tolerant v1/v2/v3 save-format
migration that `restore()` applies), and `husrekker.js` (`utm33TilLatLng`,
an inverse transverse Mercator for EUREF89/UTM zone 33 — EPSG:25833, the CRS
of the house-row polygons — plus `normaliserHusrekke`, which validates the
`{navn, crs, polygon}` shape and rejects any other CRS loudly).

### `lydnivakart.html`: grid/ekvidistanser feature (the newest, most involved part)

Two draggable corner markers define a rectangular grid over the map. For
each cell, cumulative dB from all placed units is computed and rendered as
dB-equidistance contour lines (custom marching-squares implementation, no
external dependency) at each active class-matrix limit, colored/dashed to
match the existing limit color scale. Where the over-limit region extends
past the grid, the contour is closed along the grid edge
(`boundarySegments` in `gridGeo.js`) — otherwise a saturated edge would be
invisible; simultaneously saturated limits are nested slightly inward per
active limit (strictest outermost) so they don't draw on top of each other.
A soft canvas `L.imageOverlay` (`renderFyll`) tints each cell with the
color of the *highest* active limit it exceeds — flat concentric bands
(one color per cell, deliberately non-accumulating) so the over-limit side
of each contour is readable without map-reading habits.

- **Parallelism**: a persistent pool of Web Workers (`gridWorker.js`, sized
  `min(16, hardwareConcurrency - 2)` — the shielded computation used to cost
  ~1 ms/cell with densely digitized polygons before the core got its
  vectorized hot path + polygon simplification + bulk-copy FFI; cores still
  translate directly into wait time on large grids), each independently loading its own
  `app.wasm` instance via the shared boot sequence in `wasmInit.js` (dynamic
  `import()`, not static — a static import failure would otherwise prevent
  `self.onmessage` from ever being registered and hang the worker forever).
  The per-job timeout scales with stripe size (`15 s + 3 ms/cell`), and on a
  timeout the whole pool is terminated and rebuilt (`gjenoppbyggPool`): a
  timed-out job keeps grinding inside its worker otherwise, clogging the
  message queue so every later round also appears to hang.
  Rows are split contiguously across the pool; each worker returns a
  transferable `Float64Array`. A worker computes its stripe with a single
  `acoustics_gridStripe` call — or `acoustics_gridStripeSkjermet` when the
  message carries husrekke polygons (`husPolysLocal` projects them into the
  grid's local plane per round; the «Husrekker på» master checkbox, its
  «Skjermer» sub-checkbox and loaded rows all gate this). A binary that predates `acoustics_gridStripe` is treated
  like a missing core — the worker replies `{error: true}` and the round is
  skipped. A binary that has `gridStripe` but predates the *shielded* export
  falls back to the unshielded call and flags the reply `uskjermet: true`
  (shown in the grid info line): computing without shielding only raises
  levels, so the fallback is conservative-safe, unlike a silent wrong answer.
  There is no JS per-cell fallback loop, on purpose: it would be a second
  copy of the bearing/angle policy that `Lyd.Felt` owns. Masked (in-building)
  cells arrive as NaN; `marchingSquares`/`boundarySegments` skip cells
  touching a non-finite corner so contours break at facades instead of
  feeding NaN coordinates to Leaflet.
- **Coordinates**: grid math uses a local planar (equirectangular) projection
  from the grid's SW corner, *not* Leaflet's haversine helpers — cheap and
  accurate enough at lot/neighborhood scale, and avoids needing Leaflet
  inside a worker (which has no DOM).
- **Scheduling**: `scheduleGrid()` is a busy/dirty loop (`gridBusy`/
  `gridDirty`), not a naive per-event recompute — it guarantees at most one
  in-flight computation, collapsing bursts (e.g. continuous pointer-drag
  events) into exactly one more pass once the current one finishes, instead
  of queuing an ever-growing backlog of stale work.
- **Progress**: while a round is in flight, the grid info line shows a
  stripe counter (`startFramdrift`/`stripeFerdig` in `lydnivakart.html`),
  and on full-resolution rounds (not during drag) each worker stripe is
  painted into the fill canvas as it arrives — a visible south→north wave.
  Contours still wait for the complete grid (marching squares needs every
  cell); the progressive fill reuses `fyllLayer`, so the final `renderFyll`
  replaces it seamlessly, and an aborted round repaints `lastGrid` so no
  half-painted field is left behind.
- **Resolution during interaction**: while `interacting` is true (set on
  pump/corner `drag`, cleared on `dragend`), `gridDims()` multiplies the
  configured resolution by `DRAG_COARSEN` for fast live feedback; the final
  `dragend` always triggers one full-resolution pass.
- **Cell cap**: `MAX_CELLS` auto-coarsens the effective resolution (not the
  user's setting) if the corner rectangle would exceed it, and reports this
  in the UI rather than silently truncating.
- **On/off**: `gridOn` toggles between this grid view and the older
  per-pump semicircle "halvbue" rendering (`drawPump`/`lobePts`, one pump at
  a time) — the two are mutually exclusive on the map to avoid visual
  clutter; turning the grid off is what re-enables halvbue rendering, not a
  separate code path.

### Save/load format (`snapshot()`/`restore()` in `lydnivakart.html`)

Versioned JSON (`format:"lydnivakart"`, currently `version:3`), downloaded/
re-selected by the user (no server, so no folder access — this is why it's a
manual file picker round-trip, not auto-restore). `restore()` tolerantly
migrates older shapes in place (v1 `mode`/`mount`/`bands` fields, v2's now-
removed `nabos` neighbor-point array is simply ignored if present). Add new
persisted fields by extending `snapshot()` and reading them defensively in
`restore()` — don't bump the version number for additive, tolerant changes.

### Husrekker (`husrekker/polygoner/`, drawn by `lydnivakart.html`)

The house rows at Dyst live as one JSON file per row in `husrekker/polygoner/`
(`{navn, crs: "EPSG:25833", polygon: [[east, north], ...]}`), listed by
`index.json` in the same directory — adding a row = new file + one line in the
manifest. The map page loads them at boot (independent of the wasm core) and
draws them as grey, `interactive:false` polygons, toggled by the «Husrekker
på» master checkbox (which gates the *whole* polygon feature, drawing and
computation). Fetching uses the same hybrid pattern as `default.json`: raw from
`main` first (row edits on `main` reach users without a deploy — `husrekker/**`
is in the workflow's `paths-ignore` for that reason), then relative paths
(`dist`/PR preview, dev server from the repo root). `build.sh` copies
`husrekker/` into `dist/husrekker/` as the bundled fallback.

The rows also *shield* in the grid computation via the «Skjermer (−10 dB)»
sub-checkbox, and get a worst-facade-point marker via the «Verste punkt per
rekke» sub-checkbox (`oppdaterFasadeVerst`, piggybacked on the
`runGridLoop` scheduler but independent of `gridOn`; skipped while dragging)
— both sub-checkboxes are disabled (and moot) when the master checkbox is
off, and all three are persisted
(`settings.husOn`/`settings.husSkjerm`/`settings.husVerst`, additive — no
version bump): see the shielding model under `lyd-core` and the worker
fallback under "Parallelism". Since the rows load asynchronously and
independently of the wasm core, `loadHusrekker()` calls `scheduleGrid()` once
they arrive so an already-rendered grid is recomputed with shielding.

### `default.json` hybrid live-fetch

On load, `lydnivakart.html` fetches
`frontend/static/default.json` live from `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../main/...`
(cache-busted with a timestamp query param) so editing this one file on
`main` updates everyone's default state within the CDN's ~5 min cache window,
*without* a new deploy or wasm rebuild. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` has a
`paths-ignore` on this file for exactly that reason. If the raw fetch fails
(offline/CORS), it falls back to the bundled copy shipped in `dist/`.

### CI (`.github/workflows/test-build-deploy.yml`)

`test` (native GHC, `cabal test all`) → `build` (`ghc-wasm-meta` bootstrap +
`./build.sh`) → deploy. Pushes to `main` deploy to the `gh-pages` root; open
PRs get a preview under `gh-pages/pr-preview/pr-<N>/`, cleaned up when the PR
closes. `[skip ci]`/`[ci skip]`/etc. in a commit message (push/PR only, not
manual dispatch) skips the whole workflow.
